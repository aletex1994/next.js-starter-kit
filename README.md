# Next.js Starter Kit

This is a starter kit for building web applications using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). It provides a solid foundation for building scalable and performant applications, with built-in support for server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and efficient caching.

## Features

- Server-side rendering with automatic code splitting
- Fast and efficient client-side navigation with [Next.js' Link component](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link)
- Dynamic imports for code splitting and lazy loading
- Built-in support for [CSS modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) support for CSS processing
- Easy configuration with [Next.js' API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) and [environment variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables)
- Optimized production builds with [Next.js' built-in optimizer](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/automatic-static-optimization)
- Support for [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for consistent and error-free code

## Getting Started

To get started with this starter kit, you'll need to have Node.js and npm or yarn installed on your machine. Once you have those set up, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application running

## Production Builds

To build the application for production, run `npm run build` or `yarn build`. This will generate an optimized version of the application in the `out` directory. You can then start the production server by running `npm run start` or `yarn start`.
